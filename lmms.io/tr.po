"\t\t\t\\* *This year the judging process has changed, to ensure fairer handling of entries. The change to one submission only is to allow each and every entry to be fully scored by the panel of judges. This was previously handled by a preliminary screening round to help cut down the large amount of entries received. By lowering the amount of up-front entries allowed, the judges will have the time to fully score each track entered.*"
